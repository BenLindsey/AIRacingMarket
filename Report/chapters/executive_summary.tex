\section{What is our project?}
Our task was to create an AI racing market - a platform for users to submit racing algorithms in a driving simulation that would be rendered with the Unity engine. In the future, algorithm markets could be applied in other problem domains (e.g. in finance).

\section{Who is our customer?}
This project is co-supervised by G-Research, a financial services company that evaluates, forecasts and simulates investment ideas across multiple financial asset classes. They produce software and services across a range of markets, allowing the deployment of these investment ideas and portfolio risk management.
